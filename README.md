kLib
====

A collection of Python functions for applications in oceanography and science 
in general. This module references to the numpy, scipy, pylab and probably 
other Python packages too.

Functions are grouped in different modules such as statistics, file management, 
graphics, mapping, interpolation and common functions.

This library is still in it's infancy and under development. Eventually everything
will become depreciated and moved to the `atlantis` module.
